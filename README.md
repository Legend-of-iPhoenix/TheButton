# TheButton
_Who last pressed TheButton?_

TheButton is a King-of-the-Hill-esque game where the username of the last person to click the button is broadcasted to everyone. To join in on the fun, you can register or sign in with Google.

## Basic Gameplay
You are trying to get the highest time you can in total. Whenever you click, a clock starts ticking up. Someone else can click, and start their timer. You can steal back, by clicking again. 

## Rules
Abuse is not tolerated. You may not use any form of cheating to try to get you a better score. Auto-clickers (Defined as a script or extension that clicks faster than you can, or anything that clicks while you're away) are prohibited. If you find something else that can help people cheat, please report it to \_iPhoenix\_ via Cemetech PM or IRC. 

## Other Informtion
There is a scoreboard of the 5 people with the highest scores, with 1st place at the top and 5th place at the bottom. Your score does not live-update, so if it doesn't, don't think that it is a bug. 

## Bugs
As this is still in development, there may still be some bugs. If you find one, please make a GitHub issue so we know about it, and then we can try to fix it. Any hacks available that allow users to gain unfair advantages over others should be reported to \_iPhoenix\_ so it can be patched. 

## Development
If you want to help with anything on this, make a fork of this repository, make your edits there, and make a pull request from that to this repository when you're done. Make sure to test it before submitting. Keeping your fork updated is your responsibility. Optimizations are always welcome. If you changed the style or the layout, when you make a pull request, include a screenshot of your new version. Please do not fake the image. If you find any errors in the ReadMe or anything that is really small, just make a branch and pull from there. 

## Reporting abuse
If you see someone's time increasing faster than normal, live-updating, or see them clicking like virtually at the same time they send a message on a chatting service such as SAX or IRC or something like that, report it to \_iPhoenix\_ because that person could either be the victim of a bug, a hacker, be a hacker themselves or be very good at sending a message and then switching to another tab to click TheButton. If they are consistently on, like after a long period of time, clicking right after anyone that clicks, report that, and we can check their clicking history. We are trying to create as user-friendly an environment as possible.
