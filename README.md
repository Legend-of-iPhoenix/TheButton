# TheButton
Who last pressed TheButton?

TheButton is a King-of-the-Hill-esque game where the username of the last person to click a button is broadcast to everyone. To join in on the fun, you can register or sign in with Google.

## Basic Gameplay
You are trying to get the highest time you can in total. When you click, a clock starts ticking up. Someone else can click, and start their timer. You can steal back, by clicking again. 

## Rules
Abuse is not tolerated. You may not use any form of cheating to try to get you a better score. Something that is not allowed is an auto-clicker (Defined as a script or extension that clicks faster than you can, or anything that clicks while you're away). If you find something else that can help people cheat, please report it to \_iPhoenix\_ via Cemetech PM or IRC.
