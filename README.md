# TheButton
_Who last pressed TheButton?_

TheButton is a King-of-the-Hill-esque game in which the username of the last person to click the button is publicly broadcasted. To join in on the fun, register or sign in with Google.

## Basic Gameplay
Each time you click the button, your clock starts ticking, and when someone else clicks, yours pauses and their timer starts. Your aim is to get the highest possible total time. This time (the amount of time your username is shown on the screen) is recorded on a leaderboard, which is occasionally reset. 

## Other Informtion
A leaderboard shows the players with the top five scores. Scores do not live-update, so if yours doesn't, don't think that it is a bug. Using a mouse is not cheating. 

## Bugs
This project is under development; if you find a bug or typo, please create an issue in this repository. Discovered hacks that could give users unfair advantages should be reported to \_iPhoenix\_ so that they may be patched.

## Development
Optimizations are always welcome. If you would like to make a contribution, fork this repository, commit your edits to it, then make a pull request from your fork to this repository. Keeping your fork updated is your responsibility. Be sure to test your changes before submitting, and if you altered the style or layout, please include a screenshot of the new version in your pull request.

## Reporting Abuse
Our aim is to create a fair, user-friendly environment. If you notice someone's time increasing faster than possible, live-updating, or see them clicking at the exact same time they send a message on a chatting service such as IRC or Discord, report it to \_iPhoenix\_. Also report users who are continuously active for long periods of time, clicking immediately after anyone else clicks; we will review their clicking history.

## Auto-clicking Disclaimer
Abuse is not tolerated, and you may not use any form of cheating to get a better score. Auto-clickers (scripts or extensions that click faster than you can, make it easier to click or click while you're away) are strictly prohibited. A player who is found to be using an auto-clicker will receive a warning, and will be banned for a time if the behavior continues. Bans may be appealed by submitting a Google Form, but attempting to get around the ban altogether will only result in the ban being extended. Attempting to hack the database is also not accepted; the same consequences will apply.

We want TheButton to be fun and fair, so players who feel the need to use an auto-clicker should not play. If you find something that can help people cheat, or know of someone who is using an auto-clicker, please report it to \_iPhoenix\_.

## New Features
When you are in control of the button, it will have a random background color and the "Click Me" text will become an animated rainbow. Enjoy!
