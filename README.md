# TheButton
_Who last pressed TheButton?_

TheButton is a King-of-the-Hill-esque game where the username of the last person to click the button is broadcasted to everyone. To join in on the fun, you can register or sign in with Google.

## Basic Gameplay
You are trying to get the highest time you can in total. Whenever you click, a clock starts ticking up. Someone else can click, and start their timer. You can steal back, by clicking again. 

## Rules
Abuse is not tolerated. You may not use any form of cheating to try to get you a better score. Auto-clickers (Defined as a script or extension that clicks faster than you can, or anything that clicks while you're away) are prohibited. If you find something else that can help people cheat, please report it to \_iPhoenix\_ via Cemetech PM or IRC. 

## Other Informtion
There is a scoreboard of the 5 people with the highest scores, with 1st place at the top and 5th place at the bottom. Your score does not live-update, so if it doesn't, it is not a bug. 

## Bugs
As this is still in development, there may still be some bugs. If you find one, please make a GitHub issue.

## Development
If you want to help with anything on this, make a fork of the document, make your edits there, and make a Pull Request when you're done. Make sure to test it before submitting. Keeping your fork updated is yoru responsibility. 

## Reporting abuse
If you see someone's time increasing faster than normal, live-updating, or see them clicking after they send a message or something like that, report it to \_iPhoenix\_ because that person could either be the victim of a bug, a hacker, or be a hacker themselves.
